# [orangc](https://orangc.is-a.dev)'s walls, catppuccin mocha edition
Yoh, this is my collection of wallpapers, converted to the [catppuccin-mocha](https://catppuccin.com) color pallete.
The version that hasn't been converted to catppuccin is [here](https://github.com/orxngc/walls).
Feel free to fork or leave a star!
